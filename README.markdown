1. There should be only 1 contest at any point in time.
2. During a contest, all users have access to all problems, thereby removing the need of access control.
3. Analysis mode will be a big plus.
4. Use YAML files to import/export contests.
5. Generators and graders should be implemented as (private) RubyGems and are, ideally, executed in a sandboxed environment.
6. All in all, we are literally building the simplified version of [CMS](http://cms-dev.github.io/).
